This is achieved very simply using a convention within Markdown that indicates the start of each new slide.\nAs both horizontal and vertical slides are supported by reveal.js each has it\u0026rsquo;s own unique delimiter.\nTo denote the start of a horizontal slide simply add the following delimiter in your Markdown:\n---  To denote the start of a vertical slide simply add the following delimiter in your Markdown:\n___  By using a combination of horizontal and vertical slides you can customize the navigation within your slideshow presentation. Typically vertical slides are used to present information below a top-level horizontal slide.\nFor example, a very simple slideshow presentation can be created as follows\n+++ draft = false title = \u0026quot;test\u0026quot; date = \u0026quot;2017-04-24T18:36:24+02:00\u0026quot; type=\u0026quot;slide\u0026quot; theme = \u0026quot;league\u0026quot; [revealOptions] transition= 'concave' controls= true progress= true history= true center= true +++ # In the morning ___ ## Getting up - Turn off alarm - Get out of bed ___ ## Breakfast - Eat eggs - Drink coffee --- # In the evening ___ ## Dinner - Eat spaghetti - Drink wine ___ ## Going to sleep - Get in bed - Count sheep   click here to view this page rendered\n"
