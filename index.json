	"tags": [],
	"description": "The Attachments shortcode displays a list of files attached to a page.",
	"content": " The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People Habit 1: Be Proactive Your life doesn\u0026rsquo;t just \u0026ldquo;happen.\u0026rdquo; Whether you know it or not, it is carefully designed by you. The choices, after all, are yours. You choose happiness. You choose sadness. You choose decisiveness. You choose ambivalence. You choose success. You choose failure. You choose courage. You choose fear. Just remember that every moment, every situation, provides a new choice. And in doing so, it gives you a perfect opportunity to do things differently to produce more positive results.\nHabit 1: Be Proactive is about taking responsibility for your life. You can\u0026rsquo;t keep blaming everything on your parents or grandparents. Proactive people recognize that they are \u0026ldquo;response-able.\u0026rdquo; They don\u0026rsquo;t blame genetics, circumstances, conditions, or conditioning for their behavior. They know they choose their behavior. Reactive people, on the other hand, are often affected by their physical environment. They find external sources to blame for their behavior. If the weather is good, they feel good. If it isn\u0026rsquo;t, it affects their attitude and performance, and they blame the weather. All of these external forces act as stimuli that we respond to. Between the stimulus and the response is your greatest power\u0026ndash;you have the freedom to choose your response. One of the most important things you choose is what you say. Your language is a good indicator of how you see yourself. A proactive person uses proactive language\u0026ndash;I can, I will, I prefer, etc. A reactive person uses reactive language\u0026ndash;I can\u0026rsquo;t, I have to, if only. Reactive people believe they are not responsible for what they say and do\u0026ndash;they have no choice.\nInstead of reacting to or worrying about conditions over which they have little or no control, proactive people focus their time and energy on things they can control. The problems, challenges, and opportunities we face fall into two areas\u0026ndash;Circle of Concern and Circle of Influence.\nProactive people focus their efforts on their Circle of Influence. They work on the things they can do something about: health, children, problems at work. Reactive people focus their efforts in the Circle of Concern\u0026ndash;things over which they have little or no control: the national debt, terrorism, the weather. Gaining an awareness of the areas in which we expend our energies in is a giant step in becoming proactive. Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind So, what do you want to be when you grow up? That question may appear a little trite, but think about it for a moment. Are you\u0026ndash;right now\u0026ndash;who you want to be, what you dreamed you\u0026rsquo;d be, doing what you always wanted to do? Be honest. Sometimes people find themselves achieving victories that are empty\u0026ndash;successes that have come at the expense of things that were far more valuable to them. If your ladder is not leaning against the right wall, every step you take gets you to the wrong place faster.\nHabit 2 is based on imagination\u0026ndash;the ability to envision in your mind what you cannot at present see with your eyes. It is based on the principle that all things are created twice. There is a mental (first) creation, and a physical (second) creation. The physical creation follows the mental, just as a building follows a blueprint. If you don\u0026rsquo;t make a conscious effort to visualize who you are and what you want in life, then you empower other people and circumstances to shape you and your life by default. It\u0026rsquo;s about connecting again with your own uniqueness and then defining the personal, moral, and ethical guidelines within which you can most happily express and fulfill yourself. Begin with the End in Mind means to begin each day, task, or project with a clear vision of your desired direction and destination, and then continue by flexing your proactive muscles to make things happen.\nOne of the best ways to incorporate Habit 2 into your life is to develop a Personal Mission Statement. It focuses on what you want to be and do. It is your plan for success. It reaffirms who you are, puts your goals in focus, and moves your ideas into the real world. Your mission statement makes you the leader of your own life. You create your own destiny and secure the future you envision. Habit 3: Put First Things First To live a more balanced existence, you have to recognize that not doing everything that comes along is okay. There\u0026rsquo;s no need to overextend yourself. All it takes is realizing that it\u0026rsquo;s all right to say no when necessary and then focus on your highest priorities.\nHabit 1 says, \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re in charge. You\u0026rsquo;re the creator.\u0026rdquo; Being proactive is about choice. Habit 2 is the first, or mental, creation. Beginning with the End in Mind is about vision. Habit 3 is the second creation, the physical creation. This habit is where Habits 1 and 2 come together. It happens day in and day out, moment-by-moment. It deals with many of the questions addressed in the field of time management. But that\u0026rsquo;s not all it\u0026rsquo;s about. Habit 3 is about life management as well\u0026ndash;your purpose, values, roles, and priorities. What are \u0026ldquo;first things?\u0026rdquo; First things are those things you, personally, find of most worth. If you put first things first, you are organizing and managing time and events according to the personal priorities you established in Habit 2. Habit 4: Think Win-Win Think Win-Win isn\u0026rsquo;t about being nice, nor is it a quick-fix technique. It is a character-based code for human interaction and collaboration.\nMost of us learn to base our self-worth on comparisons and competition. We think about succeeding in terms of someone else failing\u0026ndash;that is, if I win, you lose; or if you win, I lose. Life becomes a zero-sum game. There is only so much pie to go around, and if you get a big piece, there is less for me; it\u0026rsquo;s not fair, and I\u0026rsquo;m going to make sure you don\u0026rsquo;t get anymore. We all play the game, but how much fun is it really?\nWin-win sees life as a cooperative arena, not a competitive one. Win-win is a frame of mind and heart that constantly seeks mutual benefit in all human interactions. Win-win means agreements or solutions are mutually beneficial and satisfying. We both get to eat the pie, and it tastes pretty darn good!\nA person or organization that approaches conflicts with a win-win attitude possesses three vital character traits: 1. Integrity: sticking with your true feelings, values, and commitments 2. Maturity: expressing your ideas and feelings with courage and consideration for the ideas and feelings of others 3. Abundance Mentality: believing there is plenty for everyone Many people think in terms of either/or: either you\u0026rsquo;re nice or you\u0026rsquo;re tough. Win-win requires that you be both. It is a balancing act between courage and consideration. To go for win-win, you not only have to be empathic, but you also have to be confident. You not only have to be considerate and sensitive, you also have to be brave. To do that\u0026ndash;to achieve that balance between courage and consideration\u0026ndash;is the essence of real maturity and is fundamental to win-win. Habit 5: Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood Communication is the most important skill in life. You spend years learning how to read and write, and years learning how to speak. But what about listening? What training have you had that enables you to listen so you really, deeply understand another human being? Probably none, right?\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re like most people, you probably seek first to be understood; you want to get your point across. And in doing so, you may ignore the other person completely, pretend that you\u0026rsquo;re listening, selectively hear only certain parts of the conversation or attentively focus on only the words being said, but miss the meaning entirely. So why does this happen? Because most people listen with the intent to reply, not to understand. You listen to yourself as you prepare in your mind what you are going to say, the questions you are going to ask, etc. You filter everything you hear through your life experiences, your frame of reference. You check what you hear against your autobiography and see how it measures up. And consequently, you decide prematurely what the other person means before he/she finishes communicating. Do any of the following sound familiar?\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, I know just how you feel. I felt the same way.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I had that same thing happen to me.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Let me tell you what I did in a similar situation.\u0026rdquo;\nBecause you so often listen autobiographically, you tend to respond in one of four ways: Evaluating: You judge and then either agree or disagree. Probing: You ask questions from your own frame of reference. Advising: You give counsel, advice, and solutions to problems. Interpreting: You analyze others\u0026rsquo; motives and behaviors based on your own experiences.\nYou might be saying, \u0026ldquo;Hey, now wait a minute. I\u0026rsquo;m just trying to relate to the person by drawing on my own experiences. Is that so bad?\u0026rdquo; In some situations, autobiographical responses may be appropriate, such as when another person specifically asks for help from your point of view or when there is already a very high level of trust in the relationship. Habit 6: Synergize To put it simply, synergy means \u0026ldquo;two heads are better than one.\u0026rdquo; Synergize is the habit of creative cooperation. It is teamwork, open-mindedness, and the adventure of finding new solutions to old problems. But it doesn\u0026rsquo;t just happen on its own. It\u0026rsquo;s a process, and through that process, people bring all their personal experience and expertise to the table. Together, they can produce far better results that they could individually. Synergy lets us discover jointly things we are much less likely to discover by ourselves. It is the idea that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. One plus one equals three, or six, or sixty\u0026ndash;you name it.\nWhen people begin to interact together genuinely, and they\u0026rsquo;re open to each other\u0026rsquo;s influence, they begin to gain new insight. The capability of inventing new approaches is increased exponentially because of differences.\nValuing differences is what really drives synergy. Do you truly value the mental, emotional, and psychological differences among people? Or do you wish everyone would just agree with you so you could all get along? Many people mistake uniformity for unity; sameness for oneness. One word\u0026ndash;boring! Differences should be seen as strengths, not weaknesses. They add zest to life. Habit 7: Sharpen the Saw Sharpen the Saw means preserving and enhancing the greatest asset you have\u0026ndash;you. It means having a balanced program for self-renewal in the four areas of your life: physical, social/emotional, mental, and spiritual. Here are some examples of activities: Physical: Beneficial eating, exercising, and resting Social/Emotional: Making social and meaningful connections with others Mental: Learning, reading, writing, and teaching Spiritual: Spending time in nature, expanding spiritual self through meditation, music, art, prayer, or service\nAs you renew yourself in each of the four areas, you create growth and change in your life. Sharpen the Saw keeps you fresh so you can continue to practice the other six habits. You increase your capacity to produce and handle the challenges around you. Without this renewal, the body becomes weak, the mind mechanical, the emotions raw, the spirit insensitive, and the person selfish. Not a pretty picture, is it?\nFeeling good doesn\u0026rsquo;t just happen. Living a life in balance means taking the necessary time to renew yourself. It\u0026rsquo;s all up to you. You can renew yourself through relaxation. Or you can totally burn yourself out by overdoing everything. You can pamper yourself mentally and spiritually. Or you can go through life oblivious to your well-being. You can experience vibrant energy. Or you can procrastinate and miss out on the benefits of good health and exercise. You can revitalize yourself and face a new day in peace and harmony. Or you can wake up in the morning full of apathy because your get-up-and-go has got-up-and-gone. Just remember that every day provides a new opportunity for renewal\u0026ndash;a new opportunity to recharge yourself instead of hitting the wall. All it takes is the desire, knowledge, and skill.\n3 types of people • Those that make things happen • Those that watch things happen • Those that say “what happened?” There is always going to be someone better, always. That shouldn’t stop you from putting on the best performance possible. Yesterday, did I do my best to: 1. Be (increase) happy? 2. Find meaning? 3. Be fully engaged? 4. Build relationships? 5. Set clear goals? 6. Make progress towards those goals? Test yourself on these daily. 1. Say quote. 2. Do these. Write them down. MBFFF\nEmotional Intelligence As you move up Skills become less important. Relationships, the ability to inspire and motivate. Relationship management. Emphasize. How to bring these skills to the forefront when things get intense.\nObjectives Our brains are wired to avoid conflict, to keep us safe. Increase your ability to stay uncomfortable. To share information that needs to be shared to maintain / stay committed to a common goal. It’s not about group hugs. It’s about having enough skill to stay in a relationship long enough to get done what needs to get done.\n"

	"content": " The Now Habit Key Takeaways and Insights Live your life from choice\nA leadership function of your higher, human brain and your new identity as a producer.\nProcrastinators do finish, but the work at the last minute creates unnecessary anxiety and diminishes quality.\nProcrastination is a mechanism for coping with the anxiety associated with starting or completing any task or decision.\n Creating safety Reprogramming negative attitudes through positive self-talk Using the symptom to trigger the cure Guilt-free play Three-dimensional thinking and the reverse calendar Making worry work for you The Unschedule Setting realistic goals Working in the flow state Controlled setbacks  Our worst critic is ourselves\n• Feeling that you need to force yourself, that you need internal conflict because it is human nature to be lazy.\ni. Unconditional acceptance\nProcrastination provides temporary relief from stress.\nProcrastination isn’t the problem; it’s a symptom of other problems.\nCh 2 Observe yourself objectively – don’t judge or analyze your behavior.\nSetting priorities – similar to Covey’s quadrant approach.\nTrack Time for everything:\n• Find ways to free up time and avoid wasted activities.\n• Procrastination log.\n• Record procrastination patterns and inner dialogue.\ni. Include basic information the day and time that you procrastinated, the activity you postponed and its priority, your thoughts and feelings about the task, your reason for procrastinating, the type of procrastination you used, your attempts at reducing anxiety, and your resultant thoughts and feelings.\nYou will continue to procrastinate until you adopt a strategy that allows you to find full satisfaction in starting on your high-priority projects.\nSituations:\n1. Board 100 feet long, 4 inches wide.\n2. Now the board is 100 feet in the air.\n3. Now the building on your end is on fire.\n5 Stages\n1. You give a task or a goal the power to determine your worth and happiness.\n• Have to break the equation that self-worth = performance.\n2. You use perfectionism to raise the task 100 feet above the ground.\n3. You find yourself frozen with anxiety as a natural response.\n4. You then use the procrastination to escape your dilemma.\n5. You then use a real threat, such as a fire or a deadline, to release yourself from perfectionism and to act as a motivator.\nNow imagine the board 100 feet in the air has a safety net 3 feet below it.\nYou want these safety nets in your life.\n“Whatever happens I will survive. I will find a way to carry on. I will not let this be the end of the world for me. I will find a way to lessen the pain in my life and maximize the joy.”\nYou must create a protected and indisputable sense of worth for yourself.\nSuccessful people normally have failed many times without it affecting their sense of worth and drive.\nCh 3 How you talk to yourself represents the attitudes and beliefs that determine how you feel and act. The self-talk of procrastinators often unconsciously suggests and reinforces feelings of victimhood, burden, and resistance to authority.\n“I have to” or “I should do” • Communicates that I don’t want to do it, but must force myself. • Talking to yourself like a threatening parent to a child.\n“I choose” or “I decide”\nEvery “have to” needs to be replaced with an adult decision about how you will begin the project or how you will explain that you will not do it.\nThe self-talk of “should” has the same negative effect as setting counterproductive goals, envying others, and longing for the future. It creates a sense of burden, victimhood, and failure.\nDon’t worry about the “should have’s” of the past; the past is gone.\nDon’t worry about the “shoulds” in regards to the future.\nMake the future “shoulds” constructive by asking “when is the next time I can start working toward that goal?”\nClearly communicate to yourself what you choose to do, and when and where you will carry out your commitment to start.\nChange in perspective\nYou do have a choice. You don’t have to want to do the task, nor do you have to love it. But if you prefer it to the consequences of not doing it, you can decide to commit to it wholeheartedly.\nWhenever you catch yourself losing motivation on a project, look for the implicit “have to” in your thinking and make a decision at that moment to embrace the path – as it is, not the way you think it should be – or let go of it. It’s your choice.\nDeveloping fresh alternative self-statements that involve choice, commitment, and the ability to say no is an essential step toward having a greater range of possibilities in working on any task and in changing from a procrastinator to an effective producer.\nBeing at peace with the choices you make is right in line with Deci and Covey.\nReplace “I have to” with “I choose to” • Be aware and catch yourself doing this and immediately choose to work or accept responsibility for choosing to delay.\nReplace “I must finish” with “When can I start?” • Focuses on starting instead to the finish, which creates being overwhelmed.\nReplace “This project is so big and important” with “I can take one small step.”\n• Take one small step, one rough, rough draft; one imperfect sketch; one small hello. That’s all you need to do now.\n• With each step you will have time to appreciate your accomplishments, to gain perspective on your direction, and to recommit to your long-range goals.\nReplace “I must be perfect” with “I can be perfectly human”\n• The more perfectionist and self-critical you are, the harder it is to start on a project that you already know will never be quite good enough.\nReplace “I don’t have time to play” with “I must take time to play”\n• Knowing that you have something to look forward to in the near future – a firm commitment to recreation and time with friends – lessens the dread of difficult work.\n• “I have to finish something big and do it perfectly while working hard for long periods of time without time to play.”\n• Replaced with: “I choose to start on one small step, knowing I have plenty of time for play.”\nCh 4 One of the most devastating consequences of procrastination is that it leads to putting off living.\nProcrastinators and Workaholics have many of the same tendencies:\n• Always burdened by incomplete work\n• View their lives as being on hold\n• View human beings as lazy and that they require pressure\n• Maintain negative attitudes towards work\nKnowing that work will not deprive you of enjoying the good things of life, you can more easily tackle a large task without the fear of having it rule your life.\nPhD students who did their dissertations fast:\n• Dedicated and committed to their leisure time.\n• Their health and recreation were high priorities and an integral part of their overall plan to do good work on the dissertation.\n• Their lives were full.\nNative excitement about learning gets lost through the process of being taught.\n“Personally I’m always ready to learn, although I do not always like being taught.”\n– Winston Churchill\nThe Pull Method When attempting to motivate yourself to start working on a goal, do you push yourself toward the goal with threats, or do you use your attraction to the goal to pull you forward?\nThe pull method assumes that we are naturally inquisitives, and if we are properly rewarded for our efforts we can persevere with even the most difficult of tasks.\nThe promise of future rewards for hard work has little control over what we choose to do now.\n “Play hard in order to work more productively and efficiently.”\n Jeff reorganized his schedule to include firm commitments to exercise and friends. This made it clear to him that his periods of work in isolation would have to be short and focused.\nGuilt-free play, or at least the scheduling of it. That gives you a sense of freedom about your life that enables you to more easily settle into a short period of focused, quality work.\nA commitment to a mission that focuses your energies and brings about inner harmony, a commitment that comes from a pull toward a goal and an excitement about the process of getting there.\nCh 5 Three major fears that block action and create procrastination are:\n1. The terror of being overwhelmed\n2. The fear of failure\n3. The fear of not finishing\nTool 1: 3-dimensional thinking and the reverse calendar\nAnxiety will not become overwhelming unless you:\n1. Insist on knowing the one right place to start.\n2. Have not permitted yourself time along the course of your project for learning.\n3. Are critical of the fact that you’re only starting, and you tell yourself, “I should be finished!”.\nEach achievement is diminished by being compared with the imagined ideal. You have little tolerance or compassion for your current level of imperfection and your current level of struggle.\nBreak a project into small manageable parts. As you picture several smaller deadlines – all within your control – the paralysis caused by trying to complete a large project (with dire consequences if you fail) disappears.\nReverse calendar Start with the ultimate deadline and work backwards to the present where you can focus your energy on starting.\nAND the reverse calendar should be used immediately if you feel overwhelmed at any point.\nTool 2: The work of worrying\nWho of you can add one moment to his life’s course by worrying?\nBy alerting yourself to a potential danger without establishing a plan for how you will cope, you have done only half of the job of worrying. You’ve left out the positive “work of worrying” – developing an action plan.\nParents, bosses, and teachers often use threats and images of disaster to motivate us to achieve goals they have chosen. Such threats will only contribute to the procrastination cycle: threatening self-talk leads to anxiety, then to resistance, resulting in procrastination. Procrastination may temporarily lessen the tension of facing a challenging project and the risk of failing, but it cannot help you escape worry.\nYou have to move beyond scaring yourself with potential catastrophes. You have to direct the energy of worrying and panic into actual plans to remove the threat.\nTake these steps to move beyond “what if” towards constructive preparation for potential danger. 6 questions to ask yourself:\n What is the worst that could happen? What would I do if the worst really happened? How would I lessen the pain and get on with as much happiness as possible if the worst did occur? What alternatives would I have? What can I do now to lessen the probability of this dreaded even occurring? Is there anything I can do now to increase my chances of achieving my goal?  True confidence is knowing that whether you’re calm or anxious, whether you succeed or fail, you’ll do your best and, if necessary, be ready to pick yourself up to carry on and try again.\nTool 3: Persistent starting\nEstablishing structures for overcoming blocks and good work habits for follow-through has benefits that far outshine whatever comfort or excitement there is in procrastinating on finishing.\nWhat Laura realized is that it takes work to procrastinate and it takes work to face your fear of finishing. There’s really no escape from some form of work. Why not tackle the work that’s going to reap the most long-range benefits?\nIdentify the counterproductive statements and attitudes that tend to creep into your mind once you’ve gotten started on your work. Then use your anticipation of these negative self-statements to prepare challenges that take the fear out of finishing and free up your creative energy for the good stuff.\nPrepare challenges to negative statement and attitudes 1. “I need to do more preparation before I can start.”\n• Realized when preparation becomes procrastination.\n2. “At this rate I’ll never finish.”\n• You cannot judge your rate of progress by your current ability or knowledge.\n3. “I should have started earlier.”\n• Doesn’t matter, you didn’t. Don’t worry about it now; Keep moving forward.\n4. “There’s only more work after this.”\n• Again, don’t worry about this. You’re in control of what you’re working on now.\n5. “It’s not working.”\n• A certain amount of discomfort is natural in stretching beyond your comfort zone into a new level of skill.\n• Maintain a resolute commitment to make things work on this path. As a producer, you are not testing a system to see if it can make your project painless, nor are you looking for the fantasized perfect plan with no problems. You are focusing on the desired results and making this path work for you.\n6. “I only need a little more time.”\n• Trying to make the finished product perfect and free from errors.\n• Need to realize that there is no level of human perfectionism that will make the work invulnerable to criticism and rejection by some people.\nKeep on starting\nEssentially, all large tasks are completed in a series of starts.\nKeep on starting, and finishing will take care of itself. When you’re afraid of finishing, keep asking, “When can I start?”\nCh 6 Trying to escape work by procrastinating will only increase your anxiety; only work will diminish your anxiety.\nYou can’t seem to get yourself to start working, at least not the way you feel about “work”. Work has meant deprivation, facing overwhelming tasks, facing insecurities and internal and external pressures for perfection, and forcing yourself to do something you’d rather not do.\nRecord every thirty minutes of uninterrupted quality work onto what I called my Unschedule.\nApplying the “pull method” of motivation, I would make certain to do something I really enjoyed.\nSchedule:\n• Committed recreational activities\n• Breaks\n• Meals\n• Socializing\n• Play\n• Chores\n• Commuting\n• Meals\n• Sleep\nThis method of scheduling encourages you to start earlier on your project, because you now realize how little times is actually available for work after you deduct daily chores, meetings, commuting, meals, sleep, and leisure.\nThe unschedule begins with the image of play and a guarantee of your leisure time, so you know you’re not procrastinating on having fun and living fully. It clearly shows that your life isn’t devoid of fun and freedom.\nThe Unschedule builds up a subconscious desire to work more and play less.\nFill in your unschedule with work on projects only after you have completed at least one-half hour.\n- It needs to be 30 minutes of uninterrupted work.\nReward yourself with a break or a change to a more enjoyable task after each period worked.\nKeep track of quality hours each day and each week to help emphasize what you did accomplish.\nAlways leave at least one full day a week for recreation and any small chores you wish to take care of.\nBefore deciding to go to a recreational activity or social commitment, take time out for just thirty minutes of work on your project.\nFocus on starting. Replace thoughts about finishing with thoughts about when, where, and on what you can start.\nThink small. Do not aim to finish a book, etc. 30 minutes of quality work.\nNever end “down”. Never stop work when you’re blocked or at the end of a section.\nYou will find work patterns with strengths and weaknesses after several weeks. You can then make adjustments as needed to better utilize your time.\nCombined with the procrastination log will help to create future motivation.\nInsights\n- You’re busier than you thought\n- Certain days are less productive than others\n- Other days are so busy that you need to lower your expectations about getting started on a big project. - Even a half-hour of work on your project is enough to maintain momentum and avoid the extra burden of having to overcome inertia tomorrow.\nIf, for example, you watch TV after giving up on a project, giving up will become an even stronger negative habit because it is followed by a reward.\nBenefits:\n1. Realistic timekeeping\n2. Thirty minutes of quality time\n3. Experiencing success – By recording time worked, you see your progress rather than your failure to meet an unrealistic schedule.\n4. Self-imposed deadlines.\n5. Newfound “free time”.\nCh 7 Characteristics of the flow state include calm, focused energy; time expansion; delight at new ideas; ease at avoiding or solving problems; and enhanced concentration.\n“Willing suspension of disbelief” – temporarily putting aside the critical faculty of your logical mind. For example, when reading a book or watching a movie.\nIn order for this shift to take place, concerns about perfection, accuracy, and acceptance must be put aside temporarily.\nFocusing exercise\n- Sitting in a chair, focus on the chair and breathing deeply with your hands in your lap.\n- Letting go of the past.\no With 3 breathes let go of what you were just currently doing.\n- Letting go of the future.\no With 3 breathes let go of the anticipated future.\n- Centering in the present.\no With 3 breathes just notice that it doesn’t take much energy to just be in the present.\nRelaxation exercise\n- Sitting in a chair, deep breathes.\n- Words in the book to repeat.\n- Relax, then with three breathes feel yourself becoming more awake and alert.\nYou can only work on one job and one step at a time.\nThe focusing exercise gave Jacob periodic two-minute breathers so he could stand back and evaluate the challenges he faced, allow himself time to push aside fears, remind himself that he didn’t have to do it all at once, and consider alternatives.\nCh 8 Each of us faces difficult times during which we are more apt to turn to procrastination as a familiar crutch.\nTest yourself with a planned setback.\n1. Choose a project on which you are likely to procrastinate.\n2. Your planned setback will point out when you are most likely to procrastinate.\n3. Notice the warning signs; feelings of being overwhelmed, deprived, isolated.\n4. Consciously choose to procrastinate for a few hours to observe the self-statements, self-criticism.\n5. Notice how this process of self-criticism leads to guilt, depression, and resentment while keeping you from actually doing the task.\nYour planned setback will point out when you are most likely to procrastinate.\nNow replay the setback, but use the tools outlined in the book.\n• Use self-statements of a producer: I choose to start now, or I will accept the consequences of choosing to delay.\n• Use the unschedule to create a realistic picture and to show guilt-free play.\n• Use the focusing exercise; focus on the present with choice, motivation, and interest.\nResilience and Hardiness\nA “failure” wants a guarantee before starting a project that everything will go perfectly, without any problems.\nA mistake will not be the end of the world because I won’t let it be. I will pick myself up and will try again – regardless of how embarrassed or hurt I feel.\nAnytime you try something new and commit yourself to a course of action you can expect some setbacks. The possibility of setbacks is not an excuse to procrastinate.\nYou may not be responsible for causing what happens to you, but you are responsible for what you do to correct it. • “why-whine”\nThe learned skill of bouncing back from disappointing performances.\nHardiness – three personality characteristics – commitment, control, and challenge.\nNotice that you’re not trying to trick yourself about the reality of the hill; you’re just taking control over your attitude and how you talk to yourself, and that changes your experience of reality.\nYou can go farther than you think you can.\nI’ve had to train myself to turn my attention away from finishing and toward the next step, the process of staying in the race.\nConcentration: Controlling Distractions\nThe large majority of distractions can be dealt with after you complete some quality work.\nIf needed quickly jot down the distractions on paper.\nIdentify and record distractions.\nAt least 5 types of distractions:\n1. Strong emotions\n2. Warnings of danger – “I have to finish by Wednesday.”\n3. “To-Do” Reminders\n4. Escape fantasies\n5. UFOs – Unidentified Flights of Originality\nEffective Goal-setting\n“Nothing is so fatiguing as the eternal hanging on of an uncompleted task.” – William James\nOne of the best-kept secrets of successful producers is their ability to let go of goals that cannot be achieved or started in the near future. To set realistic goals you must be willing to fully commit to working on the path to that goal and be capable of investing the time and energy required to start now. If you cannot find the time or motivation to start working on that goal, let go of it, or it will keep haunting you, making you feel like a procrastinator – as if you’d failed to accomplish something important that you promised yourself you would achieve. • Think of it as a wish rather than a goal.\nRemember, you are the master of your goals; don’t let unrealistic goals be used as an occasion for self-criticism and for lapsing into identifying yourself as a procrastinator.\nThree steps to applying Now Habit techniques to the task of setting goals effectively:\n1. Recognize the work of procrastinating. Let go of the fantasy that you can escape work by procrastinating. There is no path in life that requires no effort.\n2. Freely choose the entire goal. State your goal in the form of a choice or decision: “I freely choose to work on…”\na. Delaying gratification is a process of scheduling the pain and pleasure of life in such a way as to enhance the pleasure by meeting and experiencing the pain first and getting it over with.\nb. Choosing to face the pain – because getting it out of the way allows you to start on the more pleasurable parts.\n3. Create functional, observable goals. A realistic goal includes an action verb, a deadline, and a cost component, usually time or money.\na. Divide your goal into action-oriented clearly observable sub-goals.\n"
