Now a Micro Focus owned tool (as of Sept 1, 2017) that has been evolving pretty rapidly as a result of competition from a variety of competitors.  Lots of versatility allows it to be used to automate way more than simply web pages.  It can be buggy and over the years I have needed to periodically reinstall it, because it eventually stops finding objects.  Like most automation tools the is a record option, but it does require coding and you'll likely be primarily be writing code with it.
