## You've Only Got 90 Seconds

A Sunny Disposition  
Likability has something to do with how you look but a lot more to do with how you make people feel.  
•	Likeable people give loud and clear signals of their willingness to be sociable; they reveal that their public communication channels are open.  Embedded in these signals is evidence of self-confidence, sincerity and trust.  

Instinctively, we assess, undress and best-guess each other.  And if we can’t present ourselves fast and favorably, we run the risk of being politely, or impolitely, passed over.
