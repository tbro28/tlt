**what should we do**  
create feedback loops to validate assumptions  
donâ€™t optimize for the case where we are right  
focus on value, not cost  
enable an experimental approach to product dev  
make it economic to work in small batches  

UX isn't about making it pretty!  It's about helping us to think about delivering things that satisfy customers.
